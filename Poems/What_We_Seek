What We Seek

We persist, tried our best
Since time immemorial
To decipher, to discover,
The language of the universe
The origin, the shape,
And what lies beyond the material plane
We wait, we persevere
Believing in the omens of our soul
Hoping, praying
To the entities that reside above us.
We began to read the stars
Ask for signs within ephemeral objects
And the Gods watched us merrily
Laughing, Wondering,
Why we choose to seek
Things that are better left
As imagination, as a dream

But we still choose to chase
Running, stumbling
Across the vast fields of the unknown
Our curiousity are insatiable
Our hearts filled with unbounded vigor
What we want, what we need
Is a little peek in the timeless fabric
Just enough to calm our lucid desire
We are imprisoned, we are caged
Trapped in the spiral of a grand design
And the Gods may laugh and wonder
As they weave the endless cosmos
And they will fail to realize that -
humanity feels no hunger
for the forbidden fruit
What we want is not the yield itself
But the root of the truth.
