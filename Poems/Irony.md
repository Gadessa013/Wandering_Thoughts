Irony

She's a myriad of despicable lies hidden well,
A woman with superficial self-worth
She's an egoistic person that dwells in hell,
Yet, that man still loves her.

He's a mixture of stitches and wounded pride,
A man with everlasting patience.
He's a selfless person riding an ominous tide,
Yet, that woman still supports him.

She is born from the talons of atrocious lust,
A child with ever-changing future.
She's an abomination with dark tainted past,
Yet, her Mother still adores her.

He's the embodiment of worldy vices,
A father without its authority.
He's a gambler paying a heavy price,
Yet, his son still idolized him.
.

And the irony of humanity continues
So is the cycle of birth and death
We may be deeply flawed in our virtues
Yet, we are perfectly free from debt.
