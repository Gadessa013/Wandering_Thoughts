THE MERMAID

She tried to spread
Her arms and dreams
A fragile tail splashed
But with reluctant swing
amidst the painful trap
She struggled, she mourned
And caught a glimpse
of her desired throne

Her eyes are searching
Scaling the murky depth
Of this empty shore
While catching her breath
A dry screech echoes
With demands for freedom
Lost within the shoal
A salvation may come

For she's a mermaid
Trapped in a net
A pure outlandish being
Too proud to wait
She's a mystic figure
Tired with shallow seas
Reaching for new depths
Else, existence will cease

She cried in vain
Eyes devoid with tears
Why not allow her -
Dive the deepest seas
All she ever wanted
Is the uncharted blue
Her weak voice lament
Wishing for life anew.
