A Writer's Dilemma

You're a writer
And you try to
Find inspiration
In the most
Uninspired and
Prosaic things

You capture them
With your thoughts
Trapped them
In your own idea
Of Renaissance
And euphoria

The white wall
Of your aging home
Became a snow
Pure, cold, and dull
Yet, you color it
With excitement

The night sky petunia
Living in secrecy
Bloomed into a universe
With untold quasars
Endlessly Cascading
In sweet mirth

The meek lady
You always desired
Suddenly evolved
Into a demiurge
That shaped the light
Of your fervid passion

The worn out doll
With grotesque face
Long forgotten
Lived once again
Regaining its beauty
Within your metaphors

But sometimes,
Words can't twist
The grievous reality
And you end up
Lost and broken
Inside your own poems

Now fueled by pain,
Inspired by agony
You began to write again
And transform
The sweetest things
Into the most painful ones.
