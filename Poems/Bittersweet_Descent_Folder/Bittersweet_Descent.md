*Bittersweet Descent*

You fell once again
To an abyss of certainty with absurd swiftness
That can outrun fate.
Doubtless, hopeful
That you will land
Into a *promised utopia*.

Yet once again...
You were plunged.
Back to the surface
Of *doubt and despair*
And you realized
That *love*; with all its glory,
Is not a *one way ticket*.
