Hollow comfort

"it's okay" they said
Hiding their apathy
Beneath their smile
And reasurring hands.

"We are here for you"
They said. Doubtless.
As if they were given
Pure divine authority.

"You can rely on us"
They said. Smiling.
While silently sneering
At your obliviousness.

"Your demons aren't real"
They said. Unaware.
That their every words
Are the demon itself.

And their gestures
And insensible motions
Turned your fear
Into something real.

And you weakly smile
In utter disbelief
Knowing that death
Is the easiest escape.
