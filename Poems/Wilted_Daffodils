Wilted Daffodils

Let us all welcome this new season
Of false promises and treason
Of wilted hopes and daffodils
Of pollen spreading across the hills
And as they toss golden showers
We pluck and gather the fallen flowers
For we are all just a bunch of simple men
Living timidly in a burlesque den
And when the tyrants came
Bringing gifts of shame
We all lit up with fleeting joy
Shaking hands with their viceroys
And we accept them like doyen whores
Greeting them with open doors

Since every petals and pennies
That touch the floor of worn out alleys
Are enough to satiate our tied hands
For we never really cared for our motherland
And when season ends, they would hide
Trampling viciously on our week-kneed pride
They would build fortresses and castle
Preparing for another season's battle
And it may be tempting to stand and fight
Still, it's futile since we never unite
For some of us are their myrmidons
Loyal to the sound of the mocking coins
But like puppets dancing to the tune of deceit
Their ballad will end in deserving defeat.

Come my brothers, hear my plea
Now is the time to collect our fee
Let the charlatans pay the price
Of controlling the roll of the dice
All of them will stand guilty
Of plucking our hope and sympathy
And we will bury them and their will
Together with the wilted daffodils
Let their graves be the warning to all
That all fuhrers can not control their fall
Let the history itself remember
Our victory to this hellacious cycle
For we are all just a bunch of simple men
Living courageously in this burlesque den
