# RAVEN


She's a Raven, a wounded one
Perched in a fragile, lifeless branch
And I, the branch, let her rest
Letting her talons sink upon my flesh
I gave her solace, i received wounds
Yet, i never wanted her to soar again
As she was beautiful with her scars
And she was gentle with closed wings

---
Still, she was destined to chase the wind
And hunting preys is her delight
She was never pleased with my comfort
For she toyed with ferocious storms
Now she's ready once again
Her majestic wings blocked the light
And in the dark, i bid her goodbye
But she flew without gratitude
And I, the branch, was left broken
