Wandering Thoughts

The primal waves gathered
At the feet of the shores
Sending painful tremors
Of remorse and agony

And my gaze shifted
At the seemingly endless sea
Broken only by the horizon
Deceptive, just like your vows

It was infinite or so i thought
The line between the sea and sky;
Small, insignificant, yet honed
Sharp enough to severe--
Two sentient beings.

And i began to wonder
Which is colder--
Your tainted heart or this
Pure cerulean water?
